<h2>Job Seeker Dashboard</h2>

<!-- 
  This page is shown AFTER a job seeker logs in.
  - Controlled by jobseeker_dashboard view in accounts/views.py
  - Later we can expand this to show:
      • Available jobs
      • Applied jobs
      • Edit profile button
-->

<p>Welcome, {{ user.username }}! You are logged in as a Job Seeker.</p>

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{% url 'jobseeker_onboarding' %}">Edit Profile</a></li>
    <!-- Add more links here as features grow -->
  </ul>
</nav>
